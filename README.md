# BookPile

> I have: An ISBN
>
> I want: a page that I can link to like “bookpile.org/ISBN” that renders a page where I can select a country and see possible online retailers with links to their store.

This is bookpile in a nutshell. 

Currently I am collecting a list of all online stores and library websites in the 
file [websites.json](websites.json). Feel free to create a PR to add more.
